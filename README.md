# Location-Finders
We use a variety of JavaScript files and Cascade Style Sheets to create the project, we have included libraries such as jQuery. This project is crafted towards a younger audience that likes drawing and will be useful if you want to remember the flags in a fun way. 

You have a few seconds to look at a certain flag and memorize it, then you have to redraw the flag with the given colors within 20 seconds of loading. After the 20 seconds drawing is disabled. We don't include a grading system because it could be very discouraging, instead, the kids assess themselves. Our countries of choice are Bulgaria, Greece, Romania, Macedonia, Serbia, and Turkey.
